**Description:**

Functions and examples for computing the dynamic equations of motion for *serial chains with revolute joints* using Newtonian or Lagrangian approaches. Also extracts M, V, and G matrices and shows how to solve for joint accelerations for the purposes of numerical simulation.

**Usage:**

See `example.m`.
