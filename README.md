# CodeSnippets
Shared code for miscellaneous applications.

# Guidelines
- Keep code organized by language. If a language folder is not already present, create it.
- Create q new sub folder for each new addition. Add your code and a `README.md`.
- Thoroughly document your code in your `README.md`. Make it clear what the code is for and how it should be used.
- Consider adding a demo or example file.
- If there are any external dependencies, list or link to them.
